"The term “domestic dog” refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in the world today. While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same species, Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.",just right

"Though currently it is widely accepted that most species possess at least some basic form of self-perception5, the research of self-representation in nonhuman animals still mainly concentrates on seeking the existence of such higher order cognitive capacities that normally appear towards the end of the cognitive ontogeny of self-awareness in human infants6. ",too hard

"All types of dogs are in the family Canidae, the dog-like carnivorans or canids, while the genus Canis means “dog” and includes wolves, dogs, coyotes, and jackals. Their subfamily is Caninae, or canines, while their tribe is the dog-like or “true dog” tribe Canini and their sub-tribe is the wolf-like canids of Canina. Dogs are one of the first animals to be domesticated by prehistoric man.",just right 
"Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disease in domestic dogs. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of relative or absolute insulin deficiency, including immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. DM risk varies considerably between different dog breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved and contribute susceptibility or protection. Associations of particular dog leucocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes with DM have been identified, but investigations to date have only considered all breeds pooled together. The aim of this study was to analyse an expanded data set so as to identify breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes.",too hard
"Aggressive behaviour is a serious and common behaviour problem in domestic dogs1. Aggressively behaving dogs can cause public concern by biting people and other pets, with medical or even lethal consequences for the victim. In some countries, certain dog breeds are even banned or are under breed-specific restriction in order to minimize the potential risk of dog bites2,3. Additionally, aggressive behaviour often leads to surrender or even euthanasia of the dog4, disposing the aggressively behaving individuals to welfare problems. Aggressive behaviour can also arise from pain5,6, suggesting that some aggressively behaving dogs may have a disease, such as hip dysplasia7, or other painful condition which impair their welfare.",just right
"While dog owners ascribe different emotions to their pets, including jealousy, research on secondary emotions in nonhuman animals is very limited and, so far, only one study has investigated jealousy in dogs (Canis familiaris). This work explores jealousy in dogs one step further. We conducted two studies adapting a procedure devised to assess jealousy in human infants. In each study 36 adult dogs were exposed to a situation in which their owner and a stranger ignored them while directing positive attention towards three different objects: a book, a puppet and a fake dog (Study 1: furry; Study 2: plastic). Overall, the results of both studies do not provide evidence that the behavioral responses of our dogs were triggered by jealousy: we did not find a clear indication that the fake dogs were perceived as real social rivals, neither the furry nor the plastic one. Indeed, dogs exhibited a higher interest (i.e. look at, interact with) towards the fake dogs, but differences in the behavior towards the fake dog and the puppet only emerged in Study 2. In addition, many of the behaviors (protest, stress, attention seeking, aggression) that are considered distinctive features of jealousy were not expressed or were expressed to a limited extent, revealing that dogs did not actively try to regain their owner’s attention or interfere with the interaction between the owner and the faux rival. Finally, a differentiated response towards the attachment figure (the owner) and the unfamiliar person (the stranger) did not emerge.",too hard
"Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with a higher rank. The highest-ranked dog is called the alpha male. Each dog in a pack helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.",too easy
"Dogs with ancestry from a single modern breed (purebred dogs) predominate in genetic studies, which capitalize on their unusual population history and limited genetic diversity (14–16), but are a minority of all dogs (3, 17). More than 80% of the nearly 1 billion dogs on Earth are free-living, free-breeding, and not under human control (e.g., village dogs) (3). Even in countries with large purebred populations, dogs with ancestry from more than one breed are common [~50% in the United States (18)]. Herein, we use the word “mutt” to describe a dog with ancestry from more than one breed, and potentially from nonbreed populations.",too hard
"When the wind starts to howl and thunder starts to rumble, your dog may become very anxious, looking for a place to hide. Storm phobia is very common in dogs, but your dog is not just affected mentally by storms, they are also affected physically. The sound frequencies produced during storms can actually be painful to your dogs’ ears and the static electricity that accumulates in their fur due to the change of pressure can also be unpleasant.",just right
"Dogs are often called ""man's best friend"" because they fit well with human life. Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, guide dogs for blind people (along with other service dogs), and police dogs. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs were sent by Russians into outer space a few years before any human being was sent. The first dog sent up was named Laika, but she died within a few hours.",too easy
